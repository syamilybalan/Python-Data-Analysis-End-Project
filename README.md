Employee Data Analysis
**Preprocessing:**
Corrected the "Height" column by replacing it with random values between 150 cm and 180 cm to maintain consistency.

**Analysis Tasks:**
1.Team distribution and percentage split.
2.Employee segregation by position.
3.Identification of the predominant age group.
4.Team and position with the highest salary expenditure.
5.Correlation between age and salary.
**Graphical Representations:**
Visuals for team distribution, position segregation, age groups, salary expenditures, and the age-salary correlation.

**Insights:**
1. Key trends and patterns observed regarding team structures, salary investments, and the distribution of employees by age and position.

2. Team Distribution: The graph clearly depicts that the team "New Orleans Pelicans" has the highest number of players. Both "Orlando Magic" and "Minnesota Timberwolves" contributes for the lowest number of employees.
3. Position Segregation: The most number of employees come under "SG" and least under "C".
4. Predominant Age Group: The dataset shows the majority of employees are in a specific age range (25-30), possibly indicating a preference for younger talent.
5. Highest Salary Expenditure: The team "Los Angeles Lakers" has the highest salary expenditure.
6. Age and Salary Correlation: A correlation of 0.214 indicates a weak positive correlation between age and salary. This means that there is a slight tendency for salary to increase as age increases, the relationship is not very strong.
**Conclusion:**
The analysis shows that most employees are concentrated in the 25-30 age group, indicating a focus on younger talent. Certain teams and positions have the highest salary expenditure, suggesting strategic investments in key roles. There is a weak positive correlation between age and salary, meaning salary increases slightly with age, but other factors like performance and position likely play a bigger role in salary determination. Overall, the organization prioritizes specific positions and age ranges while strategically distributing its salary budget.
